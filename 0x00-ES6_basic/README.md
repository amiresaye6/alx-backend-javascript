# ES6 Basics

At the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of the following ES6 concepts:

## 1. What is ES6?

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard for JavaScript. It introduced significant enhancements and new features to the language, enhancing its readability, maintainability, and functionality.

## 2. New Features Introduced in ES6

ES6 introduced various new features, including:
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Block-scoped variables (let and const)
- Classes
- Modules
- Promises
- Spread and rest operators
- Destructuring assignment
- Iterators and generators
- And more

## 3. Difference between a Constant and a Variable

In ES6, `const` is used to declare constants, while `let` is used to declare variables. Constants cannot be reassigned after declaration, whereas variables declared with `let` can be reassigned.

## 4. Block-Scoped Variables

Variables declared with `let` and `const` have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.

## 5. Arrow Functions and Function Parameters Default

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions. They also automatically bind the `this` value of the enclosing lexical scope. Default parameters allow you to specify default values for function parameters.

## 6. Rest and Spread Function Parameters

The rest parameter (`...`) allows a function to accept any number of arguments as an array, while the spread operator (`...`) allows an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments are expected.

## 7. String Templating in ES6

Template literals, also known as template strings, provide a more flexible and readable way to create strings in JavaScript. They allow for embedding expressions and multiline strings directly within the string literals.

## 8. Object Creation and Their Properties in ES6

ES6 introduced shorthand property syntax and computed property names for creating objects. It also introduced the concept of classes and constructors for defining object blueprints.

## 9. Iterators and for-of Loops

Iterators provide a way to loop over data structures in JavaScript. The `for-of` loop is used to iterate over iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more.
