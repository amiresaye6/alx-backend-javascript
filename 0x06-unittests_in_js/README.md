# 0x06-unittests_in_js

## Description

This project is focused on unit testing and integration testing in JavaScript using Mocha, different assertion libraries (Node or Chai), spies, stubs, hooks, and async functions. It also covers writing integration tests with a small node server.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

To use Mocha to write a test suite, follow these steps:

1. Create a new test file: `touch test.js`
2. Import the necessary modules: `const assert = require('assert');`
3. Write your test cases using the Mocha syntax: `describe('Test Suite', function() { ... });`
4. Run the tests: `npm test`

To use different assertion libraries (Node or Chai), follow these steps:

1. Install the desired assertion library: `npm install chai`
2. Import the necessary modules: `const assert = require('chai').assert;`
3. Use the assertion methods provided by the library: `assert.equal(actual, expected);`

To present long test suites, consider the following tips:

1. Organize your test cases into logical groups using `describe` blocks.
2. Use descriptive names for your test cases.
3. Use comments to explain complex or important test cases.
4. Consider using a test runner that provides detailed output and reporting.

To use spies, follow these steps:

1. Install the `sinon` library: `npm install sinon`
2. Import the necessary modules: `const sinon = require('sinon');`
3. Create a spy: `const spy = sinon.spy();`
4. Use the spy in your test cases: `assert(spy.calledOnce);`

To use stubs, follow these steps:

1. Install the `sinon` library: `npm install sinon`
2. Import the necessary modules: `const sinon = require('sinon');`
3. Create a stub: `const stub = sinon.stub();`
4. Configure the stub's behavior: `stub.returns('mocked value');`
5. Use the stub in your test cases: `assert.equal(stub(), 'mocked value');`

Hooks are used in Mocha to run setup and teardown code before and after tests. To use hooks, follow these steps:

1. Use the `before`, `after`, `beforeEach`, and `afterEach` functions provided by Mocha.
2. Place your setup and teardown code inside these functions.
3. The `before` and `after` functions run once before and after the entire test suite.
4. The `beforeEach` and `afterEach` functions run before and after each test case.

To unit test async functions, follow these steps:

1. Use the `async` and `await` keywords to handle asynchronous code.
2. Use the `done` callback provided by Mocha to handle async tests.
3. Wrap your async code in a try-catch block to handle errors.

To write integration tests with a small node server, follow these steps:

1. Set up a small node server using a framework like Express.
2. Write test cases that make HTTP requests to the server and assert the expected responses.
3. Use a library like `supertest` to simplify making HTTP requests in your tests.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```
npm test
```
