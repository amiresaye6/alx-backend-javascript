# Essential Concepts for Working with Classes in Python

Upon completing this project, you should be able to confidently explain the following concepts related to working with classes in Python:

## 1. How to define a Class

- Understand the syntax and structure of defining a class in Python.
- Define attributes and methods within a class to encapsulate data and behavior.

## 2. How to add methods to a class

- Define methods within a class to perform specific actions or operations on the class's data.
- Use self as the first parameter in class methods to access instance variables and other methods within the class.

## 3. Why and how to add a static method to a class

- Static methods are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and are bound to the class rather than an instance of the class.
- Use static methods to define utility functions that are related to the class but do not require access to instance variables.

## 4. How to extend a class from another# Project Knowledge Requirements

By the end of this project, you should be proficient in the following JavaScript concepts:

## JavaScript Array Methods

### Map, Filter, and Reduce

- **Map**: Transform each element of an array.
  
- **Filter**: Create a new array with elements that pass a test.

- **Reduce**: Execute a reducer function to get a single output value.

## Typed Arrays

- Efficiently handle binary data using Typed Arrays.

## Data Structures

### Set

- Store unique values.

### Map

- Store key-value pairs.

### WeakMap

- Store keys as objects and allows them to be garbage collected.


- Inheritance allows you to create a new class that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass).
- Use the subclass (derived class) to add new functionality or override methods from the superclass.

## 5. Metaprogramming and symbols

- Metaprogramming refers to the technique of writing code that manipulates other code at runtime.
- Symbols, represented by instances of the built-in Symbol class, are unique identifiers used to prevent naming conflicts and enable metaprogramming features.

By mastering these concepts, you will gain a solid understanding of class-based programming in Python and be well-equipped to design and implement complex systems using object-oriented principles.
