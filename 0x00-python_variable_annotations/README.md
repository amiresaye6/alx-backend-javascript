## Type Annotations in Python 3

Type annotations in Python 3 allow you to specify the expected types of variables, function arguments, and return values.

## Function Signatures and Variable Types

Type annotations can be used to specify function signatures and variable types, making your code more readable and maintainable.

## Duck Typing

Duck typing is a programming style where the type or the class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. Python's dynamic typing and duck typing make it flexible and powerful.

## Validating Code with Mypy

Mypy is a static type checker for Python that can validate your code against the type annotations you've added, helping you catch type-related errors early in the development process.
